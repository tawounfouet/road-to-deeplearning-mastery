      "earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing. water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets. sufficient water to fill the oceans may have been on earth since it formed. in this model, atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming sun had only 70% of its current luminosity. by 3.5 ga, earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.as the molten outer layer of earth cooled it formed the first solid crust, which is thought to have been mafic in composition. the first continental crust, which was more felsic in composition, formed by the partial melting of this mafic crust. the presence of grains of the mineral zircon of hadean age in eoarchean sedimentary rocks suggests that at least some felsic crust existed as early as 4.4 ga, only 140 ma after earth's formation. there are two main models of how this initial small volume of continental crust evolved to reach its current abundance: (1) a relatively steady growth up to the present day, which is supported by the radiometric dating of continental crust globally and (2) an initial rapid growth in the volume of continental crust during the archean, forming the bulk of the continental crust that now exists, which is supported by isotopic evidence from hafnium in zircons and neodymium in sedimentary rocks. the two models and the data that support them can be reconciled by large-scale recycling of the continental crust, particularly during the early stages of earth's history.new continental crust forms as a result of plate tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from earth's interior. over the period of hundreds of millions of years, tectonic forces have caused areas of continental crust to group together to form supercontinents that have subsequently broken apart. at approximately 750 ma, one of the earliest known supercontinents, rodinia, began to break apart. the continents later recombined to form pannotia at 600–540 ma, then finally pangaea, which also began to break apart at 180 ma.the most recent pattern of ice ages began about 40 ma, and then intensified during the pleistocene about 3 ma. high- and middle-latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every 21,000, 41,000 and 100,000 years. the last glacial period, colloquially called the \"last ice age\", covered large parts of the continents, up to the middle latitudes, in ice and ended about 11,700 years ago.\n",

      "chemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. a half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all current life arose. the evolution of photosynthesis allowed the sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. the resultant molecular oxygen (o2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (o3) in the upper atmosphere. the incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes. true multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized earth's surface. among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in western australia, biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in western greenland, and remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in western australia. the earliest direct evidence of life on earth is contained in 3.45 billion-year-old australian rocks showing fossils of microorganisms.during the neoproterozoic, 1000 to 539 ma, much of earth might have been covered in ice. this hypothesis has been termed \"snowball earth\", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity. following the cambrian explosion, 535 ma, there have been at least five major mass extinctions and many minor ones. apart from the proposed current holocene extinction event, the most recent was 66 ma, when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but largely spared small animals such as insects, mammals, lizards and birds. mammalian life has diversified over the past 66 mys, and several million years ago an african ape gained the ability to stand upright. this facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the evolution of humans. the development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having an influence on earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues to this day.\n",

      "earth's shape furthermore has local topographic variations. though the largest variations, like the mariana trench (10,925 meters or 35,843 feet below local sea level), only shortens earth's average radius by 0.17% and mount everest (8,848 meters or 29,029 feet above local sea level) lengthens it by only 0.14%. earth's surface is farthest out from earth's center of mass at its equatorial bulge, making the summit of the chimborazo volcano in ecuador (6,384.4 km or 3,967.1 mi) the farthest point.\n",

      "the main part of earth's magnetic field is generated in the core, the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. the field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a dipole. the poles of the dipole are located close to earth's geographic poles. at the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is 3.05×10−5 t, with a magnetic dipole moment of 7.79×1022 am2 at epoch 2000, decreasing nearly 6% per century (although it still remains stronger than its long time average). the convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. this causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. the most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.the extent of earth's magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere. ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail. because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bow shock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as earth rotates. the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the van allen radiation belts are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but contained in the magnetosphere.during magnetic storms and substorms, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the aurora.\n",

      "the orbital speed of earth averages about 29.78 km/s (107,200 km/h; 66,600 mph), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to earth's diameter, about 12,742 km (7,918 mi), in seven minutes, and the distance to the moon, 384,000 km (239,000 mi), in about 3.5 hours.the moon and earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32 days relative to the background stars. when combined with the earth-moon system's common orbit around the sun, the period of the synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53 days. viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of earth, the moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. viewed from a vantage point above the sun and earth's north poles, earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the sun. the orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: earth's axis is tilted some 23.44 degrees from the perpendicular to the earth-sun plane (the ecliptic), and the earth-moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1 degrees against the earth-sun plane. without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.the hill sphere, or the sphere of gravitational influence, of earth is about 1.5 million km (930,000 mi) in radius. this is the maximum distance at which earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant sun and planets. objects must orbit earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the sun. earth, along with the solar system, is situated in the milky way and orbits about 28,000 light-years from its center. it is about 20 light-years above the galactic plane in the orion arm.\n",

      "\n",
      "the axial tilt of earth is approximately 23.439281° with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the celestial poles. due to earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. this causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the northern hemisphere occurring when the tropic of cancer is facing the sun, and in the southern hemisphere when the tropic of capricorn faces the sun. in each instance, winter occurs simultaneously in the opposite hemisphere. during the summer, the day lasts longer, and the sun climbs higher in the sky. in winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. above the arctic circle and below the antarctic circle there is no daylight at all for part of the year, causing a polar night, and this night extends for several months at the poles themselves. these same latitudes also experience a midnight sun, where the sun remains visible all day.by astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the solstices—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the sun—and the equinoxes, when earth's rotational axis is aligned with its orbital axis. in the northern hemisphere, winter solstice currently occurs around 21 december; summer solstice is near 21 june, spring equinox is around 20 march and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 september. in the southern hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.the angle of earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. its axial tilt does undergo nutation; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6 years. the orientation (rather than the angle) of earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800-year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year. both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the sun and the moon on earth's equatorial bulge. the poles also migrate a few meters across earth's surface. this polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion. in addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the chandler wobble. earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.in modern times, earth's perihelion occurs around 3 january, and its aphelion around 4 july. these dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as milankovitch cycles. the changing earth-sun distance causes an increase of about 6.8% in solar energy reaching earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. because the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun at about the same time that earth reaches the closest approach to the sun, the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the sun than does the northern over the course of a year. this effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere.\n",

      "earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, gradually becoming thinner and fading into outer space. three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11 km (6.8 mi) of the surface; this lowest layer is called the troposphere. energy from the sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. this lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. the result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.the primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°. ocean heat content and currents are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.earth receives 1361 w/m2 of solar irradiance. the amount of solar energy that reaches the earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. at higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. as a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about 0.4 °c (0.7 °f) per degree of latitude from the equator. earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the tropical (or equatorial), subtropical, temperate and polar climates.further factors that affect a location's climates are its proximity to oceans, the oceanic and atmospheric circulation, and topology. places close to oceans typically have colder summers and warmer winters, due to the fact that oceans can store large amounts of heat. the wind transports the cold or the heat of the ocean to the land. atmospheric circulation also plays an important role: san francisco and washington dc are both coastal cities at about the same latitude. san francisco's climate is significantly more moderate as the prevailing wind direction is from sea to land. finally, temperatures decrease with height causing mountainous areas to be colder than low-lying areas.water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. when atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation. most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. this water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.the commonly used köppen climate classification system has five broad groups (humid tropics, arid, humid middle latitudes, continental and cold polar), which are further divided into more specific subtypes. the köppen system rates regions based on observed temperature and precipitation. surface air temperature can rise to around 55 °c (131 °f) in hot deserts, such as death valley, and can fall as low as −89 °c (−128 °f) in antarctica.\n",

      "the upper atmosphere, the atmosphere above the troposphere, is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on earth. the kármán line, defined as 100 km (62 mi) above earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from earth's gravity. this causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. the leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on earth. in the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\n",
      "bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\n",
      "the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\n",
      "conversations in it, âand what is the use of a book,â thought Alice\n",
      "âwithout pictures or conversations?â\n",
      "\n",
      "So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\n",
      "hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\n",
      "making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\n",
      "picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\n",
      "close by her.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\n",
      "so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, âOh\n",
      "dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!â (when she thought it over afterwards,\n",
      "it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\n",
      "time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\n",
      "watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\n",
      "on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\n",
      "had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\n",
      "watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\n",
      "field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\n",
      "large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\n",
      "in the world she was to get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\n",
      "dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\n",
      "about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\n",
      "deep well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\n",
      "plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\n",
      "was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\n",
      "what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\n",
      "looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\n",
      "cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\n",
      "hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\n",
      "passed; it was labelled âORANGE MARMALADEâ, but to her great\n",
      "disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\n",
      "of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\n",
      "cupboards as she fell past it.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell!â thought Alice to herself, âafter such a fall as this, I shall\n",
      "think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave theyâll all think me\n",
      "at home! Why, I wouldnât say anything about it, even if I fell off the\n",
      "top of the house!â (Which was very likely true.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? âI wonder how\n",
      "many miles Iâve fallen by this time?â she said aloud. âI must be\n",
      "getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\n",
      "be four thousand miles down, I thinkââ (for, you see, Alice had learnt\n",
      "several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\n",
      "though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\n",
      "knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\n",
      "practice to say it over) ââyes, thatâs about the right distanceâbut\n",
      "then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude Iâve got to?â (Alice had no\n",
      "idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\n",
      "grand words to say.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently she began again. âI wonder if I shall fall right _through_\n",
      "the earth! How funny itâll seem to come out among the people that walk\n",
      "with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I thinkââ (she was rather\n",
      "glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didnât sound at all\n",
      "the right word) ââbut I shall have to ask them what the name of the\n",
      "country is, you know. Please, Maâam, is this New Zealand or Australia?â\n",
      "(and she tried to curtsey as she spokeâfancy _curtseying_ as youâre\n",
      "falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) âAnd what\n",
      "an ignorant little girl sheâll think me for asking! No, itâll never do\n",
      "to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.â\n",
      "\n",
      "Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\n",
      "talking again. âDinahâll miss me very much to-night, I should think!â\n",
      "(Dinah was the cat.) âI hope theyâll remember her saucer of milk at\n",
      "tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\n",
      "no mice in the air, Iâm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and thatâs\n",
      "very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?â And here\n",
      "Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\n",
      "dreamy sort of way, âDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?â and\n",
      "sometimes, âDo bats eat cats?â for, you see, as she couldnât answer\n",
      "either question, it didnât much matter which way she put it. She felt\n",
      "that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\n",
      "walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n",
      "âNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?â when suddenly,\n",
      "thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\n",
      "the fall was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\n",
      "she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\n",
      "long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\n",
      "it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\n",
      "and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, âOh my ears\n",
      "and whiskers, how late itâs getting!â She was close behind it when she\n",
      "turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\n",
      "herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\n",
      "from the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\n",
      "Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\n",
      "door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\n",
      "get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\n",
      "glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Aliceâs\n",
      "first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\n",
      "but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\n",
      "but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\n",
      "time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\n",
      "behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\n",
      "little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\n",
      "much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\n",
      "passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\n",
      "out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\n",
      "flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\n",
      "through the doorway; âand even if my head would go through,â thought\n",
      "poor Alice, âit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\n",
      "how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\n",
      "knew how to begin.â For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\n",
      "happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\n",
      "indeed were really impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\n",
      "back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\n",
      "any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\n",
      "time she found a little bottle on it, (âwhich certainly was not here\n",
      "before,â said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\n",
      "label, with the words âDRINK ME,â beautifully printed on it in large\n",
      "letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all very well to say âDrink me,â but the wise little Alice was\n",
      "not going to do _that_ in a hurry. âNo, Iâll look first,â she said,\n",
      "âand see whether itâs marked â_poison_â or notâ; for she had read\n",
      "several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\n",
      "eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\n",
      "_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\n",
      "such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\n",
      "and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\n",
      "bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\n",
      "bottle marked âpoison,â it is almost certain to disagree with you,\n",
      "sooner or later.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this bottle was _not_ marked âpoison,â so Alice ventured to\n",
      "taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\n",
      "flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\n",
      "hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n",

      "it muttering to itself âThe Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\n",
      "my fur and whiskers! Sheâll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\n",
      "ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?â Alice guessed in a\n",
      "moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\n",
      "gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\n",
      "they were nowhere to be seenâeverything seemed to have changed since\n",

      "doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\n",
      "a fan! Quick, now!â And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\n",

      "âHow queer it seems,â Alice said to herself, âto be going messages for\n",
      "a rabbit! I suppose Dinahâll be sending me on messages next!â And she\n",
      "began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: ââMiss Alice! Come\n",
      "here directly, and get ready for your walk!â âComing in a minute,\n",
      "nurse! But Iâve got to see that the mouse doesnât get out.â Only I\n",

      "pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\n",
      "gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\n",
      "little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\n",
      "this time with the words âDRINK ME,â but nevertheless she uncorked it\n",
      "and put it to her lips. âI know _something_ interesting is sure to\n",
      "happen,â she said to herself, âwhenever I eat or drink anything; so\n",
      "Iâll just see what this bottle does. I do hope itâll make me grow large\n",

      "\n",
      "It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\n",
      "drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\n",

      "down the bottle, saying to herself âThatâs quite enoughâI hope I shanât\n",
      "grow any moreâAs it is, I canât get out at the doorâI do wish I hadnât\n",
      "drunk quite so much!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\n",
      "and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\n",
      "was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\n",
      "one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\n",
      "Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\n",
      "of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself âNow I\n",
      "can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?â\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\n",
      "and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\n",
      "seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\n",
      "again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "âIt was much pleasanter at home,â thought poor Alice, âwhen one wasnât\n",
      "always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\n",
      "rabbits. I almost wish I hadnât gone down that rabbit-holeâand yetâand\n",
      "yetâitâs rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\n",
      "_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\n",
      "that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\n",
      "one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\n",
      "when I grow up, Iâll write oneâbut Iâm grown up now,â she added in a\n",
      "sorrowful tone; âat least thereâs no room to grow up any more _here_.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âBut then,â thought Alice, âshall I _never_ get any older than I am\n",
      "now? Thatâll be a comfort, one wayânever to be an old womanâbut\n",
      "thenâalways to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldnât like _that!_â\n",
      "\n",

      "And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\n",

      "she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "âMary Ann! Mary Ann!â said the voice. âFetch me my gloves this moment!â\n",
      "Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\n",
      "the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\n",
      "house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\n",
      "large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\n",
      "the door opened inwards, and Aliceâs elbow was pressed hard against it,\n",
      "that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself âThen Iâll\n",
      "go round and get in at the window.â\n",
      "\n",
      "â_That_ you wonât!â thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\n",
      "she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\n",
      "hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\n",
      "but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\n",
      "from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\n",
      "cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next came an angry voiceâthe RabbitâsââPat! Pat! Where are you?â And\n",
      "then a voice she had never heard before, âSure then Iâm here! Digging\n",
      "for apples, yer honour!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âDigging for apples, indeed!â said the Rabbit angrily. âHere! Come and\n",
      "help me out of _this!_â (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n",
      "\n",
      "âNow tell me, Pat, whatâs that in the window?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âSure, itâs an arm, yer honour!â (He pronounced it âarrum.â)\n",
      "\n",
      "âAn arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\n",
      "window!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âSure, it does, yer honour: but itâs an arm for all that.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell, itâs got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!â\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\n",
      "now and then; such as, âSure, I donât like it, yer honour, at all, at\n",
      "all!â âDo as I tell you, you coward!â and at last she spread out her\n",
      "hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\n",
      "_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. âWhat a number\n",
      "of cucumber-frames there must be!â thought Alice. âI wonder what\n",
      "theyâll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\n",
      "_could!_ Iâm sure _I_ donât want to stay in here any longer!â\n",
      "\n",
      "She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\n",
      "rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\n",
      "talking together: she made out the words: âWhereâs the other\n",
      "ladder?âWhy, I hadnât to bring but one; Billâs got the otherâBill!\n",
      "fetch it here, lad!âHere, put âem up at this cornerâNo, tie âem\n",
      "together firstâthey donât reach half high enough yetâOh! theyâll do\n",
      "well enough; donât be particularâHere, Bill! catch hold of this\n",
      "ropeâWill the roof bear?âMind that loose slateâOh, itâs coming down!\n",
      "Heads below!â (a loud crash)ââNow, who did that?âIt was Bill, I\n",
      "fancyâWhoâs to go down the chimney?âNay, _I_ shanât! _You_ do\n",
      "it!â_That_ I wonât, then!âBillâs to go downâHere, Bill! the master says\n",
      "youâre to go down the chimney!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âOh! So Billâs got to come down the chimney, has he?â said Alice to\n",
      "herself. âShy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldnât be in\n",
      "Billâs place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\n",
      "I _think_ I can kick a little!â\n",
      "\n",
      "She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\n",
      "she heard a little animal (she couldnât guess of what sort it was)\n",
      "scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\n",
      "saying to herself âThis is Bill,â she gave one sharp kick, and waited\n",
      "to see what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of âThere goes Bill!â\n",
      "then the Rabbitâs voice alongââCatch him, you by the hedge!â then\n",
      "silence, and then another confusion of voicesââHold up his headâBrandy\n",
      "nowâDonât choke himâHow was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\n",
      "us all about it!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (âThatâs Bill,â thought\n",
      "Alice,) âWell, I hardly knowâNo more, thank ye; Iâm better nowâbut Iâm\n",
      "a deal too flustered to tell youâall I know is, something comes at me\n",
      "like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!â\n",
      "\n",
      "âSo you did, old fellow!â said the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "âWe must burn the house down!â said the Rabbitâs voice; and Alice\n",
      "called out as loud as she could, âIf you do, Iâll set Dinah at you!â\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, âI\n",
      "wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, theyâd take the\n",
      "roof off.â After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\n",
      "Alice heard the Rabbit say, âA barrowful will do, to begin with.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âA barrowful of _what?_â thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\n",
      "for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\n",
      "window, and some of them hit her in the face. âIâll put a stop to\n",
      "this,â she said to herself, and shouted out, âYouâd better not do that\n",
      "again!â which produced another dead silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\n",
      "little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\n",
      "head. âIf I eat one of these cakes,â she thought, âitâs sure to make\n",
      "_some_ change in my size; and as it canât possibly make me larger, it\n",
      "must make me smaller, I suppose.â\n",
      "\n",
      "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\n",
      "began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\n",
      "through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\n",
      "little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\n",
      "was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\n",
      "something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\n",
      "appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\n",
      "safe in a thick wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "âThe first thing Iâve got to do,â said Alice to herself, as she\n",
      "wandered about in the wood, âis to grow to my right size again; and the\n",
      "second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that\n",
      "will be the best plan.â\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\n",
      "arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\n",
      "how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\n",
      "the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\n",
      "great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\n",
      "feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. âPoor little\n",
      "thing!â said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\n",
      "it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\n",
      "might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\n",
      "spite of all her coaxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\n",
      "held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\n",
      "all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\n",
      "and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\n",
      "to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\n",
      "other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\n",
      "over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\n",
      "very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\n",
      "the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\n",
      "little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\n",
      "all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\n",
      "its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\n",
      "set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\n",
      "and till the puppyâs bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "âAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!â said Alice, as she leant\n",
      "against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\n",
      "leaves: âI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, ifâif Iâd\n",
      "only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! Iâd nearly forgotten that\n",
      "Iâve got to grow up again! Let me seeâhow _is_ it to be managed? I\n",

      "\n",
      "The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\n",
      "the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\n",
      "looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\n",
      "There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\n",
      "herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\n",
      "behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\n",
      "was on the top of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\n",
      "mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\n",

      "\n",
      "âThereâs no sort of use in knocking,â said the Footman, âand that for\n",
      "two reasons. First, because Iâm on the same side of the door as you\n",
      "are; secondly, because theyâre making such a noise inside, no one could\n",
      "possibly hear you.â And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\n",
      "noise going on withinâa constant howling and sneezing, and every now\n",
      "and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\n",
      "pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "âPlease, then,â said Alice, âhow am I to get in?â\n",

      "if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\n",
      "know.â He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\n",
      "this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. âBut perhaps he canât help it,â\n",

      "\n",
      "âI shall sit here,â the Footman remarked, âtill tomorrowââ\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\n",
      "skimming out, straight at the Footmanâs head: it just grazed his nose,\n",
      "and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "ââor next day, maybe,â the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\n",

      "on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\n",

      "answers.â\n",
      "\n",
      "âIf you knew Time as well as I do,â said the Hatter, âyou wouldnât talk\n",

      "Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, heâd do almost anything\n",
      "you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine oâclock in\n",
      "the morning, just time to begin lessons: youâd only have to whisper a\n",

      "âOne, indeed!â said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\n",

      "emotions are mental states brought on by neurophysiological changes, variously associated with thoughts, feelings, behavioural responses, and a degree of pleasure or displeasure. there is currently no scientific consensus on a definition. emotions are often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, or creativity.research on emotion has increased over the past two decades with many fields contributing including psychology, medicine, history, sociology of emotions, and computer science. the numerous theories that attempt to explain the origin, function and other aspects of emotions have fostered more intense research on this topic. current areas of research in the concept of emotion include the development of materials that stimulate and elicit emotion. in addition, pet scans and fmri scans help study the affective picture processes in the brain.from a mechanistic perspective, emotions can be defined as \"a positive or negative experience that is associated with a particular pattern of physiological activity.\" emotions produce different physiological, behavioral and cognitive changes. the original role of emotions was to motivate adaptive behaviors that in the past would have contributed to the passing on of genes through survival, reproduction, and kin selection.in some theories, cognition is an important aspect of emotion. other theories, however, claim that emotion is separate from and can precede cognition. consciously experiencing an emotion is exhibiting a mental representation of that emotion from a past or hypothetical experience, which is linked back to a content state of pleasure or displeasure. the content states are established by verbal explanations of experiences, describing an internal state.emotions are complex. there are various theories on the question of whether or not emotions cause changes in our behaviour. on the one hand, the physiology of emotion is closely linked to arousal of the nervous system. emotion is also linked to behavioral tendency. extroverted people are more likely to be social and express their emotions, while introverted people are more likely to be more socially withdrawn and conceal their emotions. emotion is often the driving force behind motivation. on the other hand, emotions are not causal forces but simply syndromes of components, which might include motivation, feeling, behaviour, and physiological changes, but none of these components is the emotion. nor is the emotion an entity that causes these components.emotions involve different components, such as subjective experience, cognitive processes, expressive behavior, psychophysiological changes, and instrumental behavior. at one time, academics attempted to identify the emotion with one of the components: william james with a subjective experience, behaviorists with instrumental behavior, psychophysiologists with physiological changes, and so on. more recently, emotion is said to consist of all the components. the different components of emotion are categorized somewhat differently depending on the academic discipline. in psychology and philosophy, emotion typically includes a subjective, conscious experience characterized primarily by psychophysiological expressions, biological reactions, and mental states. a similar multi-componential description of emotion is found in sociology. for example, peggy thoits described emotions as involving physiological components, cultural or emotional labels (anger, surprise, etc.), expressive body actions, and the appraisal of situations and contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== etymology ==\n",
      "the word \"emotion\" dates back to 1579, when it was adapted from the french word émouvoir, which means \"to stir up\". the term emotion was introduced into academic discussion as a catch-all term to passions, sentiments and affections. the word \"emotion\" was coined in the early 1800s by thomas brown and it is around the 1830s that the modern concept of emotion first emerged for the english language. \"no one felt emotions before about 1830. instead they felt other things – 'passions', 'accidents of the soul', 'moral sentiments' – and explained them very differently from how we understand emotions today.\"some cross-cultural studies indicate that the categorization of \"emotion\" and classification of basic emotions such as \"anger\" and \"sadness\" are not universal and that the boundaries and domains of these concepts are categorized differently by all cultures. however, others argue that there are some universal bases of emotions (see section 6.1). in psychiatry and psychology, an inability to express or perceive emotion is sometimes referred to as alexithymia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== history ==\n",
      "human nature and the accompanying bodily sensations have always been part of the interests of thinkers and philosophers. far more extensively, this has also been of great interest to both western and eastern societies. emotional states have been associated with the divine and with the enlightenment of the human mind and body. the ever-changing actions of individuals and their mood variations have been of great importance to most of the western philosophers (including aristotle, plato, descartes, aquinas, and hobbes), leading them to propose extensive theories—often competing theories—that sought to explain emotion and the accompanying motivators of human action, as well as its consequences.\n",
      "in the age of enlightenment, scottish thinker david hume proposed a revolutionary argument that sought to explain the main motivators of human action and conduct. he proposed that actions are motivated by \"fears, desires, and passions\". as he wrote in his book treatise of human nature (1773): \"reason alone can never be a motive to any action of the will… it can never oppose passion in the direction of the will… the reason is, and ought to be, the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them\". with these lines, hume attempted to explain that reason and further action would be subject to the desires and experience of the self. later thinkers would propose that actions and emotions are deeply interrelated with social, political, historical, and cultural aspects of reality that would also come to be associated with sophisticated neurological and physiological research on the brain and other parts of the physical body.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== definitions ==\n",
      "the lexico definition of emotion is \"a strong feeling deriving from one's circumstances, mood, or relationships with others.\" emotions are responses to significant internal and external events.emotions can be occurrences (e.g., panic) or dispositions (e.g., hostility), and short-lived (e.g., anger) or long-lived (e.g., grief). psychotherapist michael c. graham describes all emotions as existing on a continuum of intensity. thus fear might range from mild concern to terror or shame might range from simple embarrassment to toxic shame. emotions have been described as consisting of a coordinated set of responses, which may include verbal, physiological, behavioral, and neural mechanisms.emotions have been categorized, with some relationships existing between emotions and some direct opposites existing. graham differentiates emotions as functional or dysfunctional and argues all functional emotions have benefits.in some uses of the word, emotions are intense feelings that are directed at someone or something. on the other hand, emotion can be used to refer to states that are mild (as in annoyed or content) and to states that are not directed at anything (as in anxiety and depression). one line of research looks at the meaning of the word emotion in everyday language and finds that this usage is rather different from that in academic discourse.in practical terms, joseph ledoux has defined emotions as the result of a cognitive and conscious process which occurs in response to a body system response to a trigger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== components ==\n",
      "according to scherer's component process model (cpm) of emotion, there are five crucial elements of emotion. from the component process perspective, emotional experience requires that all of these processes become coordinated and synchronized for a short period of time, driven by appraisal processes. although the inclusion of cognitive appraisal as one of the elements is slightly controversial, since some theorists make the assumption that emotion and cognition are separate but interacting systems, the cpm provides a sequence of events that effectively describes the coordination involved during an emotional episode.\n",
      "\n",
      "cognitive appraisal: provides an evaluation of events and objects.\n",
      "bodily symptoms: the physiological component of emotional experience.\n",
      "action tendencies: a motivational component for the preparation and direction of motor responses.\n",
      "expression: facial and vocal expression almost always accompanies an emotional state to communicate reaction and intention of actions.\n",
      "feelings: the subjective experience of emotional state once it has occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== differentiation ==\n",
      "\n",
      "emotion can be differentiated from a number of similar constructs within the field of affective neuroscience:\n",
      "feeling: not all feelings include emotion, such as the feeling of knowing. in the context of emotion, feelings are best understood as a subjective representation of emotions, private to the individual experiencing them.\n",
      "moods: diffuse affective states that generally last for much longer durations than emotions; they are also usually less intense than emotions and often appear to lack a contextual stimulus.\n",
      "affect: used to describe the underlying affective experience of an emotion or a mood.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "for more than 40 years, paul ekman has supported the view that emotions are discrete, measurable, and physiologically distinct. ekman's most influential work revolved around the finding that certain emotions appeared to be universally recognized, even in cultures that were preliterate and could not have learned associations for facial expressions through media. another classic study found that when participants contorted their facial muscles into distinct facial expressions (for example, disgust), they reported subjective and physiological experiences that matched the distinct facial expressions. ekman's facial-expression research examined six basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise.later in his career, ekman theorized that other universal emotions may exist beyond these six. in light of this, recent cross-cultural studies led by daniel cordaro and dacher keltner, both former students of ekman, extended the list of universal emotions. in addition to the original six, these studies provided evidence for amusement, awe, contentment, desire, embarrassment, pain, relief, and sympathy in both facial and vocal expressions. they also found evidence for boredom, confusion, interest, pride, and shame facial expressions, as well as contempt, relief, and triumph vocal expressions.robert plutchik agreed with ekman's biologically driven perspective but developed the \"wheel of emotions\", suggesting eight primary emotions grouped on a positive or negative basis: joy versus sadness; anger versus fear; trust versus disgust; and surprise versus anticipation. some basic emotions can be modified to form complex emotions. the complex emotions could arise from cultural conditioning or association combined with the basic emotions. alternatively, similar to the way primary colors combine, primary emotions could blend to form the full spectrum of human emotional experience. for example, interpersonal anger and disgust could blend to form contempt. relationships exist between basic emotions, resulting in positive or negative influences.jaak panksepp carved out seven biologically inherited primary affective systems called seeking (expectancy), fear (anxiety), rage (anger), lust (sexual excitement), care (nurturance), panic/grief (sadness), and play (social joy). he proposed what is known as \"core-self\" to be generating these affects.\n",

      "research on social emotion also focuses on the physical displays of emotion including body language of animals and humans (see affect display). for example, spite seems to work against the individual but it can establish an individual's reputation as someone to be feared. shame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one's standing in a community, and self-esteem is one's estimate of one's status.\n",

      "the james–lange theory has remained influential. its main contribution is the emphasis it places on the embodiment of emotions, especially the argument that changes in the bodily concomitants of emotions can alter their experienced intensity. most contemporary neuroscientists would endorse a modified james–lange view in which bodily feedback modulates the experience of emotion.

      "walter bradford cannon agreed that physiological responses played a crucial role in emotions, but did not believe that physiological responses alone could explain subjective emotional experiences. he argued that physiological responses were too slow and often imperceptible and this could not account for the relatively rapid and intense subjective awareness of emotion. he also believed that the richness, variety, and temporal course of emotional experiences could not stem from physiological reactions, that reflected fairly undifferentiated fight or flight responses. an example of this theory in action is as follows: an emotion-evoking event (snake) triggers simultaneously both a physiological response and a conscious experience of an emotion.\n",
      "phillip bard contributed to the theory with his work on animals. bard found that sensory, motor, and physiological information all had to pass through the diencephalon (particularly the thalamus), before being subjected to any further processing. therefore, cannon also argued that it was not anatomically possible for sensory events to trigger a physiological response prior to triggering conscious awareness and emotional stimuli had to trigger both physiological and experiential aspects of emotion simultaneously.\n",

      "with the two-factor theory now incorporating cognition, several theories began to argue that cognitive activity in the form of judgments, evaluations, or thoughts were entirely necessary for an emotion to occur. one of the main proponents of this view was richard lazarus who argued that emotions must have some cognitive intentionality. the cognitive activity involved in the interpretation of an emotional context may be conscious or unconscious and may or may not take the form of conceptual processing.\n",
      "lazarus' theory is very influential; emotion is a disturbance that occurs in the following order:\n",
      "\n",
      "cognitive appraisal – the individual assesses the event cognitively, which cues the emotion.\n",
      "physiological changes – the cognitive reaction starts biological changes such as increased heart rate or pituitary adrenal response.\n",
      "action – the individual feels the emotion and chooses how to react.for example: jenny sees a snake.\n",
      "\n",
      "jenny cognitively assesses the snake in her presence. cognition allows her to understand it as a danger.\n",
      "her brain activates the adrenal glands which pump adrenaline through her blood stream, resulting in increased heartbeat.\n",
      "jenny screams and runs away.lazarus stressed that the quality and intensity of emotions are controlled through cognitive processes. these processes underline coping strategies that form the emotional reaction by altering the relationship between the person and the environment.\n",
      "george mandler provided an extensive theoretical and empirical discussion of emotion as influenced by cognition, consciousness, and the autonomic nervous system in two books (mind and emotion, 1975, and mind and body: psychology of emotion and stress, 1984)\n",
      "there are some theories on emotions arguing that cognitive activity in the form of judgments, evaluations, or thoughts are necessary in order for an emotion to occur. a prominent philosophical exponent is robert c. solomon (for example, the passions, emotions and the meaning of life, 1993). solomon claims that emotions are judgments. he has put forward a more nuanced view which responds to what he has called the 'standard objection' to cognitivism, the idea that a judgment that something is fearsome can occur with or without emotion, so judgment cannot be identified with emotion. the theory proposed by nico frijda where appraisal leads to action tendencies is another example.\n",
      "it has also been suggested that emotions (affect heuristics, feelings and gut-feeling reactions) are often used as shortcuts to process information and influence behavior. the affect infusion model (aim) is a theoretical model developed by joseph forgas in the early 1990s that attempts to explain how emotion and mood interact with one's ability to process information.\n",
      "\n",
      "perceptual theorytheories dealing with perception either use one or multiples perceptions in order to find an emotion. a recent hybrid of the somatic and cognitive theories of emotion is the perceptual theory. this theory is neo-jamesian in arguing that bodily responses are central to emotions, yet it emphasizes the meaningfulness of emotions or the idea that emotions are about something, as is recognized by cognitive theories. the novel claim of this theory is that conceptually-based cognition is unnecessary for such meaning. rather the bodily changes themselves perceive the meaningful content of the emotion because of being causally triggered by certain situations. in this respect, emotions are held to be analogous to faculties such as vision or touch, which provide information about the relation between the subject and the world in various ways. a sophisticated defense of this view is found in philosopher jesse prinz's book gut reactions, and psychologist james laird's book feelings.\n",
      "affective events theoryaffective events theory is a communication-based theory developed by howard m. weiss and russell cropanzano (1996), that looks at the causes, structures, and consequences of emotional experience (especially in work contexts). this theory suggests that emotions are influenced and caused by events which in turn influence attitudes and behaviors. this theoretical frame also emphasizes time in that human beings experience what they call emotion episodes –\\ a \"series of emotional states extended over time and organized around an underlying theme.\" this theory has been utilized by numerous researchers to better understand emotion from a communicative lens, and was reviewed further by howard m. weiss and daniel j. beal in their article, \"reflections on affective events theory\", published in research on emotion in organizations in 2005.\n",

      "a situated perspective on emotion, developed by paul e. griffiths and andrea scarantino, emphasizes the importance of external factors in the development and communication of emotion, drawing upon the situationism approach in psychology. this theory is markedly different from both cognitivist and neo-jamesian theories of emotion, both of which see emotion as a purely internal process, with the environment only acting as a stimulus to the emotion. in contrast, a situationist perspective on emotion views emotion as the product of an organism investigating its environment, and observing the responses of other organisms. emotion stimulates the evolution of social relationships, acting as a signal to mediate the behavior of other organisms. in some contexts, the expression of emotion (both voluntary and involuntary) could be seen as strategic moves in the transactions between different organisms. the situated perspective on emotion states that conceptual thought is not an inherent part of emotion, since emotion is an action-oriented form of skillful engagement with the world. griffiths and scarantino suggested that this perspective on emotion could be helpful in understanding phobias, as well as the emotions of infants and animals.\n",

      "=== genetics ===\n",
      "emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. this is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems. these characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. information that is encoded in the dna sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring.\n",
      "in the five million years since the lineages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. this suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of dna, including our behaviors. students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. in voles (microtus spp.) minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to major species differences in social organization and the mating system. another potential example with behavioral differences is the focp2 gene, which is involved in neural circuitry handling speech and language. its present form in humans differed from that of the chimpanzees by only a few mutations and has been present for about 200,000 years, coinciding with the beginning of modern humans. speech, language, and social organization are all part of the basis for emotions.\n",

      "=== neurobiological explanation ===\n",
      "based on discoveries made through neural mapping of the limbic system, the neurobiological explanation of human emotion is that emotion is a pleasant or unpleasant mental state organized in the limbic system of the mammalian brain. if distinguished from reactive responses of reptiles, emotions would then be mammalian elaborations of general vertebrate arousal patterns, in which neurochemicals (for example, dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin) step-up or step-down the brain's activity level, as visible in body movements, gestures and postures. emotions can likely be mediated by pheromones (see fear).for example, the emotion of love is proposed to be the expression of paleocircuits of the mammalian brain (specifically, modules of the cingulate cortex (or gyrus)) which facilitate the care, feeding, and grooming of offspring. paleocircuits are neural platforms for bodily expression configured before the advent of cortical circuits for speech. they consist of pre-configured pathways or networks of nerve cells in the forebrain, brainstem and spinal cord.\n",
      "other emotions like fear and anxiety long thought to be exclusively generated by the most primitive parts of the brain (stem) and more associated to the fight-or-flight responses of behavior, have also been associated as adaptive expressions of defensive behavior whenever a threat is encountered. although defensive behaviors have been present in a wide variety of species, blanchard et al. (2001) discovered a correlation of given stimuli and situation that resulted in a similar pattern of defensive behavior towards a threat in human and non-human mammals.whenever potentially dangerous stimuli is presented additional brain structures activate that previously thought (hippocampus, thalamus, etc.). thus, giving the amygdala an important role on coordinating the following behavioral input based on the presented neurotransmitters that respond to threat stimuli. these biological functions of the amygdala are not only limited to the \"fear-conditioning\" and \"processing of aversive stimuli\", but also are present on other components of the amygdala. therefore, it can referred the amygdala as a key structure to understand the potential responses of behavior in danger like situations in human and non-human mammals.the motor centers of reptiles react to sensory cues of vision, sound, touch, chemical, gravity, and motion with pre-set body movements and programmed postures. with the arrival of night-active mammals, smell replaced vision as the dominant sense, and a different way of responding arose from the olfactory sense, which is proposed to have developed into mammalian emotion and emotional memory. the mammalian brain invested heavily in olfaction to succeed at night as reptiles slept – one explanation for why olfactory lobes in mammalian brains are proportionally larger than in the reptiles. these odor pathways gradually formed the neural blueprint for what was later to become our limbic brain.emotions are thought to be related to certain activities in brain areas that direct our attention, motivate our behavior, and determine the significance of what is going on around us. pioneering work by paul broca (1878), james papez (1937), and paul d. maclean (1952) suggested that emotion is related to a group of structures in the center of the brain called the limbic system, which includes the hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, hippocampi, and other structures. more recent research has shown that some of these limbic structures are not as directly related to emotion as others are while some non-limbic structures have been found to be of greater emotional relevance.\n",

      "==== prefrontal cortex ====\n",
      "there is ample evidence that the left prefrontal cortex is activated by stimuli that cause positive approach. if attractive stimuli can selectively activate a region of the brain, then logically the converse should hold, that selective activation of that region of the brain should cause a stimulus to be judged more positively. this was demonstrated for moderately attractive visual stimuli and replicated and extended to include negative stimuli.two neurobiological models of emotion in the prefrontal cortex made opposing predictions. the valence model predicted that anger, a negative emotion, would activate the right prefrontal cortex. the direction model predicted that anger, an approach emotion, would activate the left prefrontal cortex. the second model was supported.this still left open the question of whether the opposite of approach in the prefrontal cortex is better described as moving away (direction model), as unmoving but with strength and resistance (movement model), or as unmoving with passive yielding (action tendency model). support for the action tendency model (passivity related to right prefrontal activity) comes from research on shyness and research on behavioral inhibition. research that tested the competing hypotheses generated by all four models also supported the action tendency model.\n",

      "social sciences often examine emotion for the role that it plays in human culture and social interactions. in sociology, emotions are examined for the role they play in human society, social patterns and interactions, and culture. in anthropology, the study of humanity, scholars use ethnography to undertake contextual analyses and cross-cultural comparisons of a range of human activities. some anthropology studies examine the role of emotions in human activities. in the field of communication studies, critical organizational scholars have examined the role of emotions in organizations, from the perspectives of managers, employees, and even customers. a focus on emotions in organizations can be credited to arlie russell hochschild's concept of emotional labor. the university of queensland hosts emonet, an e-mail distribution list representing a network of academics that facilitates scholarly discussion of all matters relating to the study of emotion in organizational settings. the list was established in january 1997 and has over 700 members from across the globe.\n",
      "in economics, the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, emotions are analyzed in some sub-fields of microeconomics, in order to assess the role of emotions on purchase decision-making and risk perception. in criminology, a social science approach to the study of crime, scholars often draw on behavioral sciences, sociology, and psychology; emotions are examined in criminology issues such as anomie theory and studies of \"toughness,\" aggressive behavior, and hooliganism. in law, which underpins civil obedience, politics, economics and society, evidence about people's emotions is often raised in tort law claims for compensation and in criminal law prosecutions against alleged lawbreakers (as evidence of the defendant's state of mind during trials, sentencing, and parole hearings). in political science, emotions are examined in a number of sub-fields, such as the analysis of voter decision-making.\n",
      "in philosophy, emotions are studied in sub-fields such as ethics, the philosophy of art (for example, sensory–emotional values, and matters of taste and sentimentality), and the philosophy of music (see also music and emotion). in history, scholars examine documents and other sources to interpret and analyze past activities; speculation on the emotional state of the authors of historical documents is one of the tools of interpretation. in literature and film-making, the expression of emotion is the cornerstone of genres such as drama, melodrama, and romance. in communication studies, scholars study the role that emotion plays in the dissemination of ideas and messages. emotion is also studied in non-human animals in ethology, a branch of zoology which focuses on the scientific study of animal behavior. ethology is a combination of laboratory and field science, with strong ties to ecology and evolution. ethologists often study one type of behavior (for example, aggression) in a number of unrelated animals.\n",

      "a common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (for example, anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (for example, increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (for example, smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. one comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by jonathan turner (2007: 2009). two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. when people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for self, other and situation are met or not met. people can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. these four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. these more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant.\n",
      "attempts are frequently made to regulate emotion according to the conventions of the society and the situation based on many (sometimes conflicting) demands and expectations which originate from various entities. the expression of anger is in many cultures discouraged in girls and women to a greater extent than in boys and men (the notion being that an angry man has a valid complaint that needs to be rectified, while an angry women is hysterical or oversensitive, and her anger is somehow invalid), while the expression of sadness or fear is discouraged in boys and men relative to girls and women (attitudes implicit in phrases like \"man up\" or \"don't be a sissy\"). expectations attached to social roles, such as \"acting as man\" and not as a woman, and the accompanying \"feeling rules\" contribute to the differences in expression of certain emotions. some cultures encourage or discourage happiness, sadness, or jealousy, and the free expression of the emotion of disgust is considered socially unacceptable in most cultures. some social institutions are seen as based on certain emotion, such as love in the case of contemporary institution of marriage. in advertising, such as health campaigns and political messages, emotional appeals are commonly found. recent examples include no-smoking health campaigns and political campaigns emphasizing the fear of terrorism.sociological attention to emotion has varied over time. émile durkheim (1915/1965) wrote about the collective effervescence or emotional energy that was experienced by members of totemic rituals in australian aboriginal society. he explained how the heightened state of emotional energy achieved during totemic rituals transported individuals above themselves giving them the sense that they were in the presence of a higher power, a force, that was embedded in the sacred objects that were worshipped. these feelings of exaltation, he argued, ultimately lead people to believe that there were forces that governed sacred objects.\n",
      "in the 1990s, sociologists focused on different aspects of specific emotions and how these emotions were socially relevant. for cooley (1992), pride and shame were the most important emotions that drive people to take various social actions. during every encounter, he proposed that we monitor ourselves through the \"looking glass\" that the gestures and reactions of others provide. depending on these reactions, we either experience pride or shame and this results in particular paths of action. retzinger (1991) conducted studies of married couples who experienced cycles of rage and shame. drawing predominantly on goffman and cooley's work, scheff (1990) developed a micro sociological theory of the social bond. the formation or disruption of social bonds is dependent on the emotions that people experience during interactions.\n",
      "subsequent to these developments, randall collins (2004) formulated his interaction ritual theory by drawing on durkheim's work on totemic rituals that was extended by goffman (1964/2013; 1967) into everyday focused encounters. based on interaction ritual theory, we experience different levels or intensities of emotional energy during face-to-face interactions. emotional energy is considered to be a feeling of confidence to take action and a boldness that one experiences when they are charged up from the collective effervescence generated during group gatherings that reach high levels of intensity.\n",
      "there is a growing body of research applying the sociology of emotion to understanding the learning experiences of students during classroom interactions with teachers and other students (for example, milne & otieno, 2007; olitsky, 2007; tobin, et al., 2013; zembylas, 2002). these studies show that learning subjects like science can be understood in terms of classroom interaction rituals that generate emotional energy and collective states of emotional arousal like emotional climate.\n",
      "apart from interaction ritual traditions of the sociology of emotion, other approaches have been classed into one of six other categories:\n",
      "evolutionary/biological theories\n",
      "symbolic interactionist theories\n",
      "dramaturgical theories\n",
      "ritual theories\n",
      "power and status theories\n",
      "stratification theories\n",
      "exchange theoriesthis list provides a general overview of different traditions in the sociology of emotion that sometimes conceptualise emotion in different ways and at other times in complementary ways. many of these different approaches were synthesized by turner (2007) in his sociological theory of human emotions in an attempt to produce one comprehensive sociological account that draws on developments from many of the above traditions.\n",

      "=== psychotherapy and regulation ===\n",
      "emotion regulation refers to the cognitive and behavioral strategies people use to influence their own emotional experience. for example, a behavioral strategy in which one avoids a situation to avoid unwanted emotions (trying not to think about the situation, doing distracting activities, etc.). depending on the particular school's general emphasis on either cognitive components of emotion, physical energy discharging, or on symbolic movement and facial expression components of emotion different schools of psychotherapy approach the regulation of emotion differently. cognitively oriented schools approach them via their cognitive components, such as rational emotive behavior therapy. yet others approach emotions via symbolic movement and facial expression components (like in contemporary gestalt therapy).\n",

      "\n",
      "=== cross-cultural research ===\n",
      "research on emotions reveals the strong presence of cross-cultural differences in emotional reactions and that emotional reactions are likely to be culture-specific. in strategic settings, cross-cultural research on emotions is required for understanding the psychological situation of a given population or specific actors. this implies the need to comprehend the current emotional state, mental disposition or other behavioral motivation of a target audience located in a different culture, basically founded on its national, political, social, economic, and psychological peculiarities but also subject to the influence of circumstances and events.\n",

      "=== computer science ===\n",
      "\n",
      "in the 2000s, research in computer science, engineering, psychology and neuroscience has been aimed at developing devices that recognize human affect display and model emotions. in computer science, affective computing is a branch of the study and development of artificial intelligence that deals with the design of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, and process human emotions. it is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer sciences, psychology, and cognitive science. while the origins of the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical enquiries into emotion, the more modern branch of computer science originated with rosalind picard's 1995 paper on affective computing. detecting emotional information begins with passive sensors which capture data about the user's physical state or behavior without interpreting the input. the data gathered is analogous to the cues humans use to perceive emotions in others. another area within affective computing is the design of computational devices proposed to exhibit either innate emotional capabilities or that are capable of convincingly simulating emotions. emotional speech processing recognizes the user's emotional state by analyzing speech patterns. the detection and processing of facial expression or body gestures is achieved through detectors and sensors.\n",

      "emotion affects the way autobiographical memories are encoded and retrieved. emotional memories are reactivated more, they are remembered better and have more attention devoted to them. through remembering our past achievements and failures, autobiographical memories affect how we perceive and feel about ourselves.\n",

      "== notable theorists ==\n",
      "in the late 19th century, the most influential theorists were william james (1842–1910) and carl lange (1834–1900). james was an american psychologist and philosopher who wrote about educational psychology, psychology of religious experience/mysticism, and the philosophy of pragmatism. lange was a danish physician and psychologist. working independently, they developed the james–lange theory, a hypothesis on the origin and nature of emotions. the theory states that within human beings, as a response to experiences in the world, the autonomic nervous system creates physiological events such as muscular tension, a rise in heart rate, perspiration, and dryness of the mouth. emotions, then, are feelings which come about as a result of these physiological changes, rather than being their cause.silvan tomkins (1911–1991) developed the affect theory and script theory. the affect theory introduced the concept of basic emotions, and was based on the idea that the dominance of the emotion, which he called the affected system, was the motivating force in human life.some of the most influential deceased theorists on emotion from the 20th century include magda b. arnold (1903–2002), an american psychologist who developed the appraisal theory of emotions; richard lazarus (1922–2002), an american psychologist who specialized in emotion and stress, especially in relation to cognition; herbert a. simon (1916–2001), who included emotions into decision making and artificial intelligence; robert plutchik (1928–2006), an american psychologist who developed a psychoevolutionary theory of emotion; robert zajonc (1923–2008) a polish–american social psychologist who specialized in social and cognitive processes such as social facilitation; robert c. solomon (1942–2007), an american philosopher who contributed to the theories on the philosophy of emotions with books such as what is an emotion?: classic and contemporary readings (2003); peter goldie (1946–2011), a british philosopher who specialized in ethics, aesthetics, emotion, mood and character; nico frijda (1927–2015), a dutch psychologist who advanced the theory that human emotions serve to promote a tendency to undertake actions that are appropriate in the circumstances, detailed in his book the emotions (1986); jaak panksepp (1943–2017), an estonian-born american psychologist, psychobiologist, neuroscientist and pioneer in affective neuroscience.\n",
