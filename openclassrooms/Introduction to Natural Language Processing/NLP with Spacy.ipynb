      "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\r\n",
      "bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\r\n",
      "the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\r\n",

      "âwithout pictures or conversations?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\r\n",
      "hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\r\n",
      "making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\r\n",
      "picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\r\n",
      "close by her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\r\n",
      "so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, âOh\r\n",
      "dear!\n",
      "Oh dear!\n",
      "I shall be late!â (when she thought it over afterwards,\r\n",
      "it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\r\n",
      "time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\r\n",
      "watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\r\n",
      "on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\r\n",
      "had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\r\n",
      "watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\r\n",
      "field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\r\n",
      "large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\r\n",
      "in the world she was to get out again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\r\n",
      "dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\r\n",
      "about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\r\n",
      "deep well.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\r\n",
      "plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\r\n",
      "was going to happen next.\n",
      "First, she tried to look down and make out\r\n",
      "what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\r\n",
      "looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\r\n",
      "cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\r\n",
      "hung upon pegs.\n",
      "She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\r\n",
      "passed; it was labelled âORANGE MARMALADEâ, but to her great\r\n",
      "disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\r\n",
      "of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "âWell!â thought Alice to herself, âafter such a fall as this, I shall\r\n",

      "How brave theyâll all think me\r\n",
      "at home!\n",

      "getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.\n",
      "Let me see: that would\r\n",
      "be four thousand miles down, I thinkââ (for, you see, Alice had learnt\r\n",
      "several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\r\n",
      "though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\r\n",
      "knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\r\n",

      "then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude Iâve got to?â (Alice had no\r\n",

      "(and she tried to curtsey as she spokeâfancy _curtseying_ as youâre\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Down, down, down.\n",

      "And here\r\n",

      "There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\r\n",
      "and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, âOh my ears\r\n",
      "and whiskers, how late itâs getting!â She was close behind it when she\r\n",
      "turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\r\n",

      "from the roof.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\r\n",

      "first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\r\n",
      "\n",
      "but, alas!\n",
      "either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\r\n",
      "but at any rate it would not open any of them.\n",
      "However, on the second\r\n",
      "time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\r\n",
      "behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\r\n",
      "little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\r\n",
      "much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\r\n",
      "passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.\n",
      "How she longed to get\r\n",
      "out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\r\n",
      "flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\r\n",
      "through the doorway; âand even if my head would go through,â thought\r\n",
      "poor Alice, âit would be of very little use without my shoulders.\n",
      "Oh,\r\n",
      "how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!\n",
      "I think I could, if I only\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\n",
      "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\r\n",
      "back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\r\n",
      "any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\r\n",
      "time she found a little bottle on it, (âwhich certainly was not here\r\n",
      "before,â said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\r\n",

      "other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\r\n",

      "very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\r\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\r\n",

      "little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\r\n",
